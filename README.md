** Visual Odometry: Vision Based Estimation of Motion for Autonomous Driving

*** Abstract
Leveraging computer vision techniques, a system that processes sequential stereo camera images to estimate the motion of a moving vehicle, was designed. Through feature extraction, matching, and robust estimation algorithms, the system successfully tracked key points in consecutive frames, allowing for the precise calculation of the vehicle's pose and movement. The solution demonstrates the importance of vision for autonomous systems.
